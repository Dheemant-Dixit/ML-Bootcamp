# **ML-Bootcamp**
This project is a Machine Learning library, which contains Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means Clustering and 2-hidden layer Neural Networks for Regression and Classification, all implemented from scratch in Python using NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
## Datasets Used:
*   Linear Regression - `Linear_train` for training (50000 training examples) and `Linear_test` for testing (10000 testing examples), both containing 20 features.
*   Polynomial Regression - `Polynomial_train` for training (50000 training examples) and `Polynomial_test` for testing (10000 testing examples), both containing 3 features.
*   Logistic Regression - `emnist-letters-train` for training (88800 training examples) and `emnist-letters-test` for testing (14800 testing examples), both containing pixel brightness values of a 28X28 greyscale image representing English alphabets.
*   K-Nearest Neighbors - `emnist-letters-train` for training (88800 training examples) and `emnist-letters-test` for testing (14800 testing examples), both containing pixel brightness values of a 28X28 greyscale image representing English alphabets.
*   K-Means Clustering - `emnist-letters-train` for training (88800 training examples) and `emnist-letters-test` for testing (14800 testing examples), both containing pixel brightness values of a 28X28 greyscale image representing English alphabets.
*   Neural Network - Regression : `Linear_train` for training (50000 training examples) and `Linear_test` for testing (10000 testing examples), both containing 20 features, and `Polynomial_train` for training (50000 training examples) and `Polynomial_test` for testing (10000 testing examples), both containing 3 features.              Classification : `emnist-letters-train` for training (88800 training examples) and `emnist-letters-test` for testing (14800 testing examples), both containing pixel brightness values of a 28X28 greyscale image representing English alphabets.
